Nowadays, with a busy lifestyle people of all age group combat with health-related problems. Also searching for suitable blood groups and medicines in an emergency situation is strenuous task for family members which requires maximum time and human effort and sometimes becomes very critical that may cost the life of the patient. Therefore, HealthCare has become an obligatory need of every family. To solve health related problem, we propose a Web based platform to ease the process of finding suitable blood groups from nearby Blood Banks in the area. Also, the application finds generic and its substitute medicine from pharmacies available in the area using Real time Location of the respective user/s through GPS. Subsequently, it reduces paperwork on daily basis of hospital blood banks by maintaining a database that will work in real-time for blood record maintenance. Also, doctors and patients can connect through online chat facility where queries can be solved in real-time and also provide digital prescriptions to them. We also provide a Management Information System to track their daily activities and generate reports for further analysis. 

We also have a paper published in JOURNAL OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGY & INNOVATIVE RESEARCH.
